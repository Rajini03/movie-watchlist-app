This is a web based tool movie watchlist application. Users can add, view, update, and delete movies they want to watch or have already watched. They should be able to search for movies, categorize them, mark them as watched, rate them, and leave reviews.

I'm using React.js for the front end to build the user interface, Redux for state management, and CSS for styling. As for the back-end, I'm using JSON and Node.js servers.
